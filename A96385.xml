            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And whereas in thy arguments to prove the lawfulneſs of ſinging in a mixed congregation, thou art going about to juſtifie the wicked and prophane perſons ſinging, and asks why it ſhould not be lawfull for them to joyne with you in ſinging: I anſwer, with the wicked and prophane thou art joyned, who art going about to juſtifie them in thy carnall imaginations, and there amongſt the wicked thou art found, in whoſe mouth praiſes are not comely, ſaith <hi>David:</hi> therefore for the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keds ſinging and praying, thou art pleading, whoſe prayers are abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion unto God: and thou askeſt if God hath not enjoyned it by the very dictate of nature: I anſwer, here thou art going about to make God like thy ſelfe, and his teachings naturall like thine, who art found in their ſteps, who knew nothing but what they knew naturally; and in theſe things corrupted themſelves, as thou doſt, <hi>Iude</hi> 10, 11. and there thy ſinging is without God, and without his teaching, and thou ſayeſt that ſinging is a duty common to all men, but thou ſayeſt that the Sacraments hold forth visible communion, and thou brings that Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.16. &amp; 17.

Here Prieſt <hi>Clapham,</hi> out of thy own mouth thou art judged to cauſe the people to erre, who haſt confeſſed that the wicked both ſin in ſinging and praying, and yet art preaching for it; here thou haſt made it manifeſt, that thou art one of them who eat up the ſin of the people, and art ſtriving to juſtifie them in their ſins, and art proved to be a tranſgreſſor of the Law, and a teacher of others ſo to do: And whereas thou ſayeſt that <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Children of Iſrael joyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in ſinging, and that with many of them God was not wel pleaſed: I anſwer, neither is he wel pleaſed with thee and thy generation, who are found in their ſteps with whom God was not wel pleaſed, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.5, 6. who art found in Luſt and Idolatrouſneſs, which they were found in, you that are covetous are they that luſt, and are Idolaters, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.5. <hi>Col.</hi> 3.5. with whom God is not wel pleaſed; and to juſtifie the wicked ſinging, thou ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt that <hi>David</hi> calls on all Creatures to ſing praiſes unto God, and thou brings <hi>Pſal.</hi> 148. I anſwer, thou adds to <hi>Davids</hi> words, he doth not bid them ſing, but praiſe, for he in that Scripture bids the fruitfull trees, and the flying-fowle praiſe God, but he never bad ſuch fruitleſs trees as thou ſing, who cumbers the ground, neither did he ever bid the wicked ſing, as thou doſt, who are out of the Covenant, but the fruitfull trees, and the fowls of the Ayre, and the lillies of the field keep their Covenant wherein they were created: but thou who ſeeks for thy gain from thy quarter, and liveſt in pride and covetouſneſs, and takes Tythes, and Gifts, and rewards, and Teaches for filthy Lucre thy own Traditions, who art caring for thy main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance and liveliehood, thou art not come ſo far as the Ravens and the Lillies, for they witneſs againſt thee, for they take no care, and them thou doſt not conſider: and there let the Ravens, and the Lillies, and fruitfull trees, and every thing which keeps its Covenant, which do praiſe God, judge thee and condemn thee, to be out of the Covenant and out of the Saints life, among the wicked and fruitleſs trees, in whoſe mouthes praiſes are not comely: and whereas thou brings that Scripture, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1 50. in that Scripture he ſaith, praiſe him with the ſound of the Trumpet, with Pſalte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and Harp, and Cimball, and Stringed-Inſtruments, and Organs, and loud Cimballs, and Sounding Cimballs, here let all that reads this, ſee
